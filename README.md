# 17T7
Constructing 17T7 as a Galois group using modularity for RM abelian varieties. This repository contains code specifically for finding suitable Hilbert modular forms and computing the minimal polynomial of the n-torsion field. For the code that, given the Hecke eigenvalues of the HMF, computes the periods of the associated abelian variety, see the [Eichler-Shimura repo](https://github.com/edgarcosta/EichlerShimuraHMF).
