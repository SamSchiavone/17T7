# 17T7
Constructing 17T7 as a Galois group using modularity for RM abelian varieties. This repository contains code specifically for finding suitable Hilbert modular forms and computing the minimal polynomial of the n-torsion field. For the code that, given the Hecke eigenvalues of a HMF, computes the periods of the associated abelian variety, see the repo [EichlerShimuraHMF](https://github.com/edgarcosta/EichlerShimuraHMF). We search the [LMFDB](https://github.com/LMFDB/lmfdb) for HMFs with necessary and sufficient properties.
